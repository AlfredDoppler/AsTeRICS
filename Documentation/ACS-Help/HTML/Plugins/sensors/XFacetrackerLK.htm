<H3>Component Type: Sensor (Subcategory: Computer Vision)</H3>
<p>
This component provides a cross-platform face tracking computer vision algorithm which puts out estimated movement of a users’ nose and chin (not supported yet) in x and y coordinates. 
The underlying mechanism builds upon the JavaCV (OpenCV) library (in particular a trained cascade of haar-like features is used to track a face and its movement). 
The x- and y- coordinates can be used in camera-mouse configurations or to enable selection or control tasks. The values are only provided if a face can be tracked by the algorithm and are updated with the achievable frame rate. 
Note that the x- and y- values represent relative movement in pixels and have to be accumulated (e.g. via the integrate component) to generate e.g. absolute mouse positions.
<p>
<STRONG>The plugin is still experimental and should not be used for end user AT solutions at the moment.</STRONG>

<H2>Requirements</H2>
A camera has to be available (this can be any webcam or a camera which is available as image acquisition device via the operating system). The picture below shows the Logitech Webcam 9000 Pro.
